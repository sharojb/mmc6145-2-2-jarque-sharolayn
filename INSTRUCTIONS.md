(**NOTE:** View a rendered version of this file in VS Code with `ctrl-shift-v` or `cmd-shift-v`)

&nbsp;
## Introduction

For this assignment, you will be working on adding features to a memory-based card game using React. The card game portion itself and all its components are implemented for you, however, you must add scoring to the application based on the user's time to completion.

&nbsp;
## Setup

Copy the starter files inside of `unsolved` into the root directory of your GitHub repository.

Run `npm i` in the root directory of your repository (your `package.json` should be in the root directory).

To start developing, run `npm run dev`.

&nbsp;
## Instructions

To be considered complete, the app must reflect the current time when a game is being played as well as the previous and best (lowest) time after each game ends. 

To accomplish this, you will need to do the following:

- Utilize the `useTimer` custom hook inside of `App.jsx`.
- Create functions that handle starting/stopping/resetting the timer when the game starts or ends.
- Pass those functions to `CardGame` as the props `onGameStart` and `onGameEnd`.
- Pass correct values for the `time`, `bestTime` and `previousTime` props to the `Header` component.[submitted](#submission)
